# methuselah
Methuselah is a single-header, n-dimensional cellular automata library written in C++. It provides classes for defining and simulating cellular automata grids, with support for various wrapping modes, neighborhood types, and customizable cell update functions. The library includes example uses such as simulating Conway's Game of Life, Game of Life in 3D, fluid flow, and a sandpile simulation. Methuselah offers flexibility and extensibility for creating and exploring complex cellular automaton systems in multiple dimensions.

I wrote this code for fun back in 2020. It is abandoned now, but free to use for any purpose under the MIT license.
